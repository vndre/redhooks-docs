# combineReducers

```javascript
combineReducers(reducers)
```

`combineReducers` combines an object whose props are different reducer functions, into a single reducer function
* The `reducers` argument is an object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one.

```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({ counter, otherReducer })
const store = createStore(rootReducer)
```
