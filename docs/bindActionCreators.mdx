# bindActionCreators

```javascript
bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch)
```
`connect` function connects a React component to a Redhooks store. It returns a connected component class that wraps the component you passed in taking care to avoid unnecessary re-rendering. It should be used if your class or function components require expensive rendering.

* If a `mapStateToProps` function is passed, your component will be subscribed to Redhooks store. Any time the store is updated, `mapStateToProps` will be called. The results of `mapStateToProps` must be a plain object, which will be merged into your component’s props. If you don't want to connect to Redhooks store, pass null or undefined in place of mapStateToProps.
* `mapDispatchToProps`, if passed, may be either a function that returns a plain object whose values, themselves, are functions or a plain object whose values are [action creator](/bindActionCreators) functions. In both cases the props of the returned object will be merged in your component’s props. If is not passed your component will receive `dispatch` prop by default.

`bindActionCreators` turns an object whose values are [action creators](#action-creator) into an object with the
same keys, but with every function wrapped in a `dispatch` call so they
may be invoked directly.
 
* `actionCreators` An object whose values are action creator functions or plain objects whose values are action creator functions
* `dispatch` The dispatch function available on your Redhooks store.

#### Action creator
An action creator is a function that creates an action.

```javascript
type ActionCreator = (...args: any) => Action | AsyncAction
```

#### Example
`actions.js`

```javascript
export const action_1 = action_1 => action_1
export const action_2 = action_2 => action_2
export const action_3 = action_3 => action_3
```

`YourConnectedComponent.js`
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { connect, bindActionCreators } from "redhooks";
import * as actions from "./actions";

const YourComponent = ({ actions, counter }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>counter</h1>
    <button onClick={actions.action_1}>action_1</button>
    <button onClick={actions.action_2}>action_2</button>
    <button onClick={actions.action_2}>action_3</button>
  </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  counter: state.counter
});

// a verbose way
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  actions: bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch)
});
export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(YourComponent);

// or simply
export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  { actions }
)(YourComponent);
```
