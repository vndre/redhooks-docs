# Installation

  ```bash
  npm i redhooks
  yarn add redhooks
  ```

### Motivation

In the [Reactjs docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) a nice paragraph titled _useYourImagination()_ suggests to think of 
different possible usages of functionality Hooks provide, which is essentially what Redhooks tries to do.
This package does not use any third party library, being only dependent upon the Hooks and the Context API.
You do not need to install `react-redux` to connect your components to the store because you can have access to it directly from any of your
function components by utilizing the `useStore` Redhooks API. Hooks are [not allowed within class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html),
for using the store within them Redhooks exposes a Higher Order Component (HOC) named `connect`. It also supports the use of middleware like `redux-thunk`
or `redux-saga` or your own custom middleware conforming to the middleware's API.
