# createStore

```javascript
createStore(reducer, [opts])
```

`createStore` returns the store object to be passed to the `Provider`.
* The `reducer` argument might be a single reducer function, a function returned by `combineReducers` or a plain object whose values are reducer functions (if your store requires multiple reducers).
* The `opts` optional argument is an object which allows you to pass a `preloadedState`, `initialAction` and `middlewares`.

> The store is ready when the `Provider` is mounted, after which an `onload` event will be triggered.

```javascript
const opts = {
    preloadedState: 1,
    initialAction: { type: "DECREMENT" },
    middlewares: [thunk, sagaMiddleware, logger]
};

const store = createStore(reducer, opts);
store.onload = ({ dispatch }) => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
```
