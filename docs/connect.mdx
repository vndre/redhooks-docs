# connect

```javascript
connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps])
```
`connect` function connects a React component to a Redhooks store. It returns a connected component class that wraps the component you passed in taking care to avoid unnecessary re-rendering. It should be used if your class or function components require expensive rendering.

* If a `mapStateToProps` function is passed, your component will be subscribed to Redhooks store. Any time the store is updated, `mapStateToProps` will be called. The results of `mapStateToProps` must be a plain object, which will be merged into your component’s props. If you don't want to connect to Redhooks store, pass null or undefined in place of mapStateToProps.
* `mapDispatchToProps`, if passed, may be either a function that returns a plain object whose values, themselves, are functions or a plain object whose values are [action creator](/bindActionCreators) functions. In both cases the props of the returned object will be merged in your component’s props. If is not passed your component will receive `dispatch` prop by default.

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({ counter: state.counter })
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({ increment: action => dispatch({ type: action })})
// or
const mapDispatchToProps = { increment: type => ({ type })}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(ReactComponent)
```
